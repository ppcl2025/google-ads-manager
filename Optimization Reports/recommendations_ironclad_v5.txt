Account: 027 - Ironclad Equity Group
Campaign: PPCL | MSL | Nov 2025
Date Range: Last 30 days

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
This campaign shows moderate performance with 6 conversions from $3,028 spend (ROAS 0.99), but suffers from significant budget waste and bidding strategy misalignment. The campaign uses Target Spend (Manual Bidding) with extremely low impression share (9.99%) and massive lost rank share (70.49%), indicating severe budget constraints and/or bid inefficiency. Three critical issues: 17 of 23 ad groups have zero conversions while consuming 42% of total spend ($1,271), the manual bidding strategy is inappropriate for this conversion volume, and budget is severely limiting reach in a high-opportunity market.

**PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS (Top 5)**

- "liz buys houses" - Generated 1 conversion from 1 click (100% conversion rate) 
- "cash offer for home" - 1 click at high CPC ($82.85), shows high commercial intent

- "best time of year to sell a home" - Research phase, not ready to sell

**BIDDING STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS**

**Current Campaign: PPCL | MSL | Nov 2025**
- Current bidding strategy: Target Spend (Manual Bidding)
- Conversion data assessment: 6 conversions in period is below optimal threshold but sufficient for Maximize Conversions
- CPA stability analysis: Limited data but $504.63 average CPA provides baseline
- Recommended bidding strategy change: Switch to Maximize Conversions immediately
- Rationale: Manual Target Spend is causing massive impression share loss (70.49% rank lost share). With 6 conversions, algorithm has enough data to optimize more efficiently than manual bidding. Current manual approach is severely underperforming.
- Expected impact: 20-30% CPA improvement and 50-100% more conversions from better auction optimization and impression share capture

**Future progression:** After 30+ conversions with Maximize Conversions and stable CPA patterns, consider Target CPA at $400-450 range.

**BUDGET REALLOCATION**

**Current budget:** $98.68 daily ($3,000 monthly)
**Recommended reallocation:**
- Immediate: Pause 17 zero-converting ad groups (saves $1,271/month)
- Concentrate remaining $1,757/month on 3 converting ad groups:
  * Cash Buyers (PM): 50% of budget ($878/month)
  * Need (PM): 30% of budget ($527/month)  
  * We Buy Houses (PM): 20% of budget ($352/month)
- After reallocation stabilizes, increase total budget to $200-250 daily to capture lost impression share
- Expected impact: 300-400% improvement in conversion volume from budget concentration + increase

**QUALITY SCORE IMPROVEMENTS**

**Keywords with Quality Score < 7:**
- "fast home buyers" (QS 7) - Above average creative but average CTR/LP experience
  * Action: Create dedicated ad group with "fast home buyers" themed ads
- "cash home buyer" (QS 3) - Below average on all components
  * Action: Move to dedicated ad group, rewrite ads with keyword in headline 1, improve landing page H1 to match
- "sell house as is" (QS 3) - Above average creative but below average CTR/LP
  * Action: Add urgency to ad copy, test landing page focused on as-is purchases
- "sell my house fast" (QS 4) - Average creative, below average CTR/LP
  * Action: Test mobile-optimized landing page, add click-to-call prominent buttons

**Most keywords show Quality Score 0 (unspecified) indicating new keywords or insufficient data. Focus on the measured low QS keywords first.**
