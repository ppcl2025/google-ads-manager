============================================================

Account: 027 - Ironclad Equity Group
Campaign: PPCL | MSL | Nov 2025
Date Range: Last 30 days

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
Campaign performance shows concerning inefficiencies with 0.99 ROAS and $504.63 cost per conversion, far above profitable ranges for real estate investors. Critical issues: 70% of ad groups (16 of 23) generating zero conversions while consuming significant budget, bidding strategy stuck in manual Target Spend limiting optimization potential, and massive budget constraints with 21.96% lost impression share. Implementing recommended optimizations should reduce CPA to $250-300 range and improve ROAS to 1.5-2.0 within 30 days.

**PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS (Top 5)**

1. **CRITICAL - Pause Zero-Converting Ad Groups**
   - Action: Immediately pause 16 ad groups generating 0 conversions after spending $1,521.74 (50% of budget)
   - Expected Impact: Save $760/month in wasted spend, improve overall ROAS from 0.99 to 1.8-2.2
   - Implementation Priority: Critical
   - Specific ad groups to pause: As-Is (PM), Companies That Buy Houses (PM), Inherited (PM), Fast (PM), Home Buyer (PM), Who Buys Houses (PM), all Exact Match ad groups except Home Buyer (EM), Foreclosure (PM), Without A Realtor (PM)

2. **CRITICAL - Switch to Smart Bidding Strategy**
   - Action: Change from Manual Target Spend to Maximize Conversions (6 conversions meets minimum threshold)
   - Expected Impact: 15-25% CPA improvement through algorithm optimization, better budget utilization
   - Implementation Priority: Critical
   - Current manual bidding is preventing Google's algorithm from optimizing toward conversions

3. **HIGH - Increase Campaign Budget**
   - Action: Increase daily budget from $98.68 to $150-180 to capture 21.96% lost impression share
   - Expected Impact: 30-45% increase in conversions (from 6 to 8-9 monthly), maintain CPA with smart bidding
   - Implementation Priority: High
   - Budget constraint is limiting reach to motivated sellers during peak search times

4. **HIGH - Add High-Performing Search Terms as Keywords**
   - Action: Add "webuyhouses com", "liz buys houses", "sell my house for cash near me" as exact match keywords
   - Expected Impact: 20-30% CTR improvement on high-intent searches currently triggering through broad match
   - Implementation Priority: High
   - These search terms show strong conversion intent but limited impression share

5. **HIGH - Implement Aggressive Negative Keyword List**
   - Action: Add 50+ negative keywords to block low-intent searches (attorney, lawyer, fsbo, agent, realtor, diy, worth, value, estimate)
   - Expected Impact: 10-15% budget savings by eliminating irrelevant clicks, improve conversion rate
   - Implementation Priority: High
   - Search terms data shows significant waste on informational and professional service queries

**BIDDING STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS**

**Current Campaign: PPCL | MSL | Nov 2025**
- Current Strategy: TARGET_SPEND (Manual Bidding)
- Conversion Data: 6 conversions in reporting period (sufficient for smart bidding)
- CPA Pattern: $504.63 average (too high and unstable)
- Recommendation: **Switch to Maximize Conversions immediately**
- Rationale: Target Spend is focusing on spend rather than conversions; 6+ conversions meets threshold for smart bidding
- Implementation: Change bid strategy to Maximize Conversions, allow 2-week learning period
- Expected Impact: 15-25% CPA improvement, better budget utilization across high-performing keywords
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks to see stabilized performance

**Target CPA Progression Plan:**
- Phase 1: Maximize Conversions for 4-6 weeks to build conversion data
- Phase 2: Switch to Target CPA when reaching 20+ conversions/month
- Recommended Target CPA: Start at $350 (current average minus 30%), gradually decrease to $250-275

**BUDGET REALLOCATION**

**Current Budget Issues:**
- Daily budget: $98.68 causing 21.96% lost impression share
- 50% of budget wasted on zero-converting ad groups
- Missing motivated seller searches during peak hours

**Recommended Budget Changes:**
1. **Immediate**: Increase daily budget to $150 (+52% increase)
2. **After pausing waste**: Budget reallocation will improve efficiency by 40-60%
3. **Target monthly spend**: $4,500 (vs current $2,960)
4. **Expected ROI**: Additional $1,540 monthly spend should generate 5-7 additional conversions

**Budget Allocation by Ad Group (After Optimization):**
- Cash Buyers (PM): 40% of budget (highest converting)
- Need (PM): 35% of budget (good volume potential)
- We Buy Houses (PM): 25% of budget (strong CTR)

**QUALITY SCORE IMPROVEMENTS**

**Critical Quality Score Issues (Score 1-4):**
- "need to sell my house fast" - QS 1: Create dedicated SKAG, improve ad relevance
- "I need to sell my house fast" - QS 5: Add keyword to headline, improve landing page match
- "we buy houses fast" - QS 3: Separate from generic "we buy houses" ad group

**Specific Improvement Actions:**
1. **Creative Quality Issues**: 75% of keywords show "UNSPECIFIED" - indicates ad relevance problems
2. **Expected CTR Issues**: Create more compelling headlines with urgency indicators
3. **Landing Page Issues**: Ensure each ad group has situation-specific landing pages
