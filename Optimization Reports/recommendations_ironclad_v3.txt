Date Range: Last 30 days

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
This campaign is significantly underperforming with a 1.01 ROAS and $495 cost per conversion, indicating major optimization opportunities. The three critical issues are: (1) Smart Bidding strategy with only 6 conversions limiting algorithm effectiveness, (2) 70% of keywords generating zero conversions while consuming budget, and (3) extremely low 10% impression share suggesting budget constraints and poor Quality Scores. Implementing these optimizations should improve ROAS to 2.5-3.0 and reduce cost per conversion to $200-250.

**PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS (Top 5)**

1. **CRITICAL: Pause 15 Zero-Conversion Ad Groups** - Ad groups like "As-Is (PM)", "Companies That Buy Houses (PM)", "Inherited (PM)", "Fast (PM)", and "Who Buys Houses (PM)" have spent $1,027 with zero conversions. This will save $1,000+/month and allow budget reallocation to the 3 converting ad groups, potentially improving ROAS by 40%.

2. **CRITICAL: Increase Daily Budget by 150%** - Currently limited to $98.68 with 22% budget lost share and only 10% impression share. Increasing to $250/day will capture motivated sellers currently going to competitors. Expected to generate 10-15 additional conversions monthly.

3. **HIGH: Revert to Maximize Clicks Bidding Strategy** - With only 6 conversions, Maximize Conversions lacks sufficient data for optimization. Reverting to Maximize Clicks for 30 days to generate 30+ conversions before progressing back to Maximize Conversions will improve algorithm learning and reduce CPA volatility.

4. **HIGH: Pause 45 Zero-Converting Keywords** - Keywords like "sell my house as is" ($179 spent, 0 conversions), "companies that buy houses" ($165 spent, 0 conversions) are draining budget. Pausing these will save $500/month and focus spend on proven converters.

5. **HIGH: Add 15 High-Intent Negative Keywords** - Search terms like "best time of year to sell", "costs for selling a house", "paperwork needed" indicate research phase, not motivated sellers. Adding these as negatives will improve lead quality and reduce wasted spend by 15-20%.

**BIDDING STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS**

**Campaign: PPCL | MSL | Nov 2025**
- Current: MAXIMIZE_CONVERSIONS (Smart Bidding)
- Conversion Data: Only 6 conversions in period (insufficient for smart bidding)
- CPA Stability: Highly volatile due to low conversion volume
- Recommendation: **Revert to MAXIMIZE_CLICKS for 30 days**
- Rationale: Need 30+ conversions for effective smart bidding per framework
- Target: Generate 30+ conversions over next 30 days, then switch to Maximize Conversions
- Expected Impact: More stable traffic, better data collection for future smart bidding

**After 30+ Conversions Achieved:**
- Switch back to MAXIMIZE_CONVERSIONS
- After 50+ conversions and stable CPA patterns, consider TARGET_CPA at $350 (30% below current $495 average)

**BUDGET REALLOCATION**

**Current Budget Issues:**
- Daily budget: $98.68
- Budget lost impression share: 22%
- Search impression share: Only 10%
- Total monthly budget: ~$3,000

**Recommended Budget Changes:**
- Increase daily budget to $250 (+154% increase)
- Allocate saved budget from paused ad groups ($1,088/month) to top 3 performers
- Budget distribution:
  - Cash Buyers (PM): $100/day (currently converting)
  - Need (PM): $75/day (currently converting) 
  - We Buy [Ugly] Houses (PM): $50/day (currently converting)

**Expected Impact:**
- Capture additional 40-60% impression share
- Generate 10-15 additional conversions monthly
- Reduce overall CPA through volume and algorithm learning

- "sell house as is" (QS: 3) - Poor CTR, rewrite ads to focus on "as-is" benefits

- "how do you sell a house as is" (QS: 3) - Wrong intent, recommend pausing
- "sell my house fast" (QS: 4) - Improve landing page speed and mobile experience

**Specific QS Improvement Actions:**
