**BIDDING STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS**

**Current Strategy Assessment:**
- Campaign uses TARGET_SPEND (Maximize Clicks) - Smart Bidding
- Conversion Data: 6 conversions in campaign period (insufficient for progression)
- CPA Stability: Cannot assess due to low volume and recent optimization needs

**Recommendation: MAINTAIN Current Strategy**
- Rationale: With only 6 conversions, insufficient data for Maximize Conversions (need 15-30 minimum)
- The campaign needs structural fixes (pause waste, budget increase) before bidding strategy progression
- Current waste elimination will naturally improve performance within existing strategy

**Timeline for Future Assessment:**
- After implementing recommendations above, monitor for 30-45 days
- Once achieving 15+ conversions monthly with waste eliminated, reassess for Maximize Conversions
- Target progression path: Stay on Maximize Clicks → (after 30+ conversions) → Maximize Conversions → (after 50+ conversions) → Target CPA at $350-400

**BUDGET REALLOCATION**

**Current Budget Analysis:**
- Daily Budget: $98.68 ($2,960 monthly)
- Budget Lost IS: 21.96% (significant opportunity loss)
- Current Rank Lost IS: 70.49% (very high, indicates low impression share)

**Recommended Budget Changes:**
- Increase daily budget to $140-150 (+42-52% increase)
- Monthly budget increase from $2,960 to $4,200-4,500
- Rationale: 21.96% budget lost IS indicates clear demand for additional budget
- Expected Impact: 3-4 additional conversions monthly, improved impression share from 9.99% to 15-20%

**Budget Efficiency After Optimization:**
- Current waste: ~$2,515 across zero-converting ad groups  
- Post-optimization budget efficiency: 85-90% vs current ~60%
- Effective budget increase after waste elimination: 65-75% more efficient spend

**QUALITY SCORE IMPROVEMENTS**

**Critical QS Issues Identified:**
- Most keywords show Quality Score of 0 or "UNSPECIFIED" indicating serious relevance problems
- Only 7 keywords have measurable Quality Scores (1-8 range)

**Keywords Requiring Immediate QS Focus:**
- "fast home buyers" (QS 7) - Maintain performance, use as template
- "cash home buyer" (QS 3) - Below average creative quality and post-click quality
- "sell house as is" (QS 3) - Above average CTR but below average creative quality
- "we buy houses near me" (QS 5) - Below average creative and post-click quality

**Specific Actions for QS Improvement:**
