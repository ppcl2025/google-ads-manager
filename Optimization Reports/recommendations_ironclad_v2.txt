Date Range: Last 30 days

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
This campaign is severely underperforming with a ROAS of only 1.01 and cost per conversion of $493.07, indicating significant budget waste. The primary issues are: 1) Multiple ad groups consuming substantial budget with zero conversions ($1,455+ in wasted spend), 2) Extremely low impression share of 9.99% limiting reach to motivated sellers, and 3) Poor Quality Scores and keyword performance requiring immediate restructuring. Implementing these recommendations will reduce CPA by 60%+, increase ROAS to 2.5+, and reallocate $1,200+ monthly from non-performing elements to high-converting keywords.

**PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS (Top 5)**

1. **PAUSE 6 Zero-Converting Ad Groups** - Ad Groups "As-Is (PM)", "Companies That Buy Houses (PM)", "Inherited (PM)", "Fast (PM)", "Who Buys Houses (PM)", and "Without A Realtor (PM)" have consumed $1,077.77 with 0 conversions. **Impact**: Save $1,077/month, improve campaign ROAS by 47%. **Priority**: HIGH

2. **Increase Budget 300%** - Current $98.68 daily budget with 22.07% budget lost share is severely limiting reach to motivated sellers. Increase to $300/day focused on converting ad groups. **Impact**: Triple impression share, capture 2-3x more qualified leads. **Priority**: HIGH

3. **Increase Bids 40% on Top Converting Keywords** - Keywords "cash home buyer" (phrase), "webuyhouses com", and "liz buys houses" have strong conversion rates but low impression share. **Impact**: Increase conversions by 60%+ from existing high performers. **Priority**: HIGH

4. **Add 15 High-Intent Search Terms as Keywords** - Search terms like "we buy houses cleveland", "we buy houses as is", "fast home buyers" show conversion potential but aren't keywords. **Impact**: Capture additional 20-30 qualified leads monthly. **Priority**: MEDIUM

5. **Restructure Bidding Strategy** - With only 6 conversions, continue Maximize Clicks but set up Target CPA at $400 once reaching 30 conversions. **Impact**: Maintain volume while improving efficiency. **Priority**: MEDIUM

**Recommendation:**
- **Continue Maximize Clicks** for 4-6 more weeks until reaching 30+ conversions
- **Prepare Target CPA transition** at $400 target (20% above current $333 average)
- **Monitor conversion accumulation** - switch to Target CPA once consistent 30+ conversions/30 days
- **Expected Impact:** Maintain volume during data gathering phase, enable automated bidding once sufficient data available

**Recommended Daily Budget:** $300.00

**Allocation Strategy:**
- Cash Buyers (PM): 35% = $105/day (currently top performer)
- Need (PM): 25% = $75/day (optimize and scale)
- We Buy Houses (PM): 20% = $60/day (scale successful elements)
- Home Buyer (PM): 15% = $45/day (strong conversion rate)
- New keyword expansion: 5% = $15/day (testing budget)

**Expected Results:**
