## 📋 For Your Team Members

## 🚀 Benefits of This Approach

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Manual setup for each person | Everything already set up ✅ |
| Request `client_secrets.json` separately | Automatically included ✅ |
| Clone from GitHub | Just open Drive folder ✅ |
| Set up venv and install deps | Already done ✅ |
| Search for documentation | All docs in shared folder ✅ |

---

## 🔄 Git Workflow (Optional)

Since the folder is in Google Drive, you can still use git:

**✅ Do:**
- Pull latest changes: `git pull`
- Commit from one location at a time
- Push to GitHub for backup: `git push`

**⚠️ Avoid:**
- Multiple people committing simultaneously
- Committing while Drive is syncing
- Working offline (without "Available offline" enabled)

**Note:** GitHub is still the source of truth! Drive is just for easy access.
