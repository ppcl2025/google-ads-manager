## Keyword Planner Integration & Analysis

When Keyword Planner data is provided, analyze:

### Competition Analysis
- **Low Competition**: Keywords with low competition scores indicate opportunities for lower CPCs and easier ranking
- **Medium Competition**: Balanced competition - good volume with reasonable costs
- **High Competition**: May require higher bids but often indicates high-intent searches

### Search Volume Analysis
- **High Volume (>10K/month)**: Broad reach keywords - good for awareness but may have lower conversion rates
- **Medium Volume (1K-10K/month)**: Sweet spot for most campaigns - good balance of volume and intent
- **Low Volume (<1K/month)**: Long-tail keywords - highly specific, often higher conversion rates but limited reach

### Suggested Bid Analysis
- Compare suggested bids to current CPCs
- Identify opportunities where suggested bids are lower than current performance
- Flag keywords where suggested bids are significantly higher than target CPA

### Keyword Expansion Recommendations
- Use related keywords from Keyword Planner to expand campaigns
- Prioritize keywords with:
  * Medium-high search volume (1K-10K/month)
  * Low-medium competition
  * Suggested bids within target CPA range
  * Relevance to motivated seller intent

### Quality Score Indicators
- Keywords with high suggested bids but low competition may indicate Quality Score issues
- Keywords with low suggested bids and high competition may indicate strong Quality Score potential

### Integration with Campaign Analysis
When providing recommendations:
- Reference Keyword Planner data when suggesting new keywords
- Use competition data to set realistic bid expectations
- Use search volume to prioritize keyword additions
- Combine Keyword Planner insights with actual campaign performance data
