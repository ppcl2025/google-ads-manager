## Ad Copy Best Practices for Motivated Sellers

**CRITICAL - Google Ads Character Limits**:
- **Headlines**: 30 characters maximum (aim for 28-30 to maximize space)

4. NEVER exceed the character limits (ads will be rejected)
5. Include spaces and punctuation in character count

### Elements to Always Include

**Must-Have Messaging Points:**
- "AS-IS" or "Any Condition" (removes repair objection)
- Specific timeframe (7 days, this week, 24 hours)
- "No fees" or "No commission" (differentiates from agents)
- "Cash" or "Cash offer" (establishes credibility)
- Local geographic reference (city, county, state)

**Trust Signals to Test:**
- Years in business
- Number of houses purchased
- Better Business Bureau rating
- Customer reviews/testimonials count
- Licensed/bonded/insured status

### Ad Copy Red Flags to Avoid

- Generic messaging without pain point specificity
- Vague timelines ("quick", "fast" without defining)
- Missing differentiation from realtors/agents
- No emotional connection to seller situation
- Overuse of ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation
- Claims that can't be substantiated (e.g., "highest offer")
- **Exceeding character limits** (30 for headlines, 90 for descriptions) - ads will be rejected
- **Wasting character space** (headlines <25 chars, descriptions <85 chars) - not maximizing impact
- Using long words when short alternatives exist ("and" vs "&", "seven" vs "7")
- Filler words that add no value ("we offer", "our company", "you can")
