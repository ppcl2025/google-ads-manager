## Smart Bidding: What You Can and Cannot Control

### NEVER Recommend These With Smart Bidding (All Phases):

**Manual Bid Adjustments** ❌
- Do NOT recommend setting manual keyword bids
- Do NOT recommend bid adjustments by device (-20% mobile, +15% desktop, etc.)
- Do NOT recommend bid adjustments by location (zip codes, cities, states)
- Do NOT recommend ad schedule bid adjustments (time of day, day of week)
- Do NOT recommend demographic bid adjustments (age, gender, household income)

**Why?** Smart bidding algorithms (Maximize Clicks, Maximize Conversions, Target CPA) use machine learning to automatically optimize bids across ALL these dimensions in real-time. Manual adjustments interfere with the algorithm and typically reduce performance.

### What You CAN and SHOULD Recommend With Smart Bidding:

**Budget Management** ✅
- Increase/decrease daily budgets based on performance and business goals
- Recommend budget reallocation between campaigns
- Address "Limited by budget" constraints

**Targeting Refinements** ✅
- Add/remove keywords
- Add negative keywords aggressively
- Pause underperforming ad groups
- Adjust geographic targeting (include/exclude entire regions, not bid adjustments)
- Exclude devices entirely if zero conversions (rare, but possible)

**Ad Copy & Creative** ✅
- Test new ad variations
- Improve ad relevance for Quality Score
- Update headlines and descriptions
- Add/remove ad extensions

**Conversion Tracking** ✅
- Verify conversion tracking accuracy
- Adjust conversion values if using value-based bidding
- Add new conversion actions

**Audience Targeting** ✅
- Add audiences in observation mode
- Exclude audiences that don't convert
- Create custom audiences

**Campaign Structure** ✅
- Reorganize ad groups for better relevance
- Create separate campaigns for different goals/strategies
- Implement SKAG (Single Keyword Ad Groups) for low QS keywords

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:

**DON'T Say**: "Decrease mobile bids by 20% since mobile CPA is higher"

**DO Say**: "Monitor mobile performance; if mobile never converts after 60 days with significant spend, consider excluding mobile devices entirely (rare but possible). Otherwise, let smart bidding optimize."

**DON'T Say**: "Increase bids on 'sell my house fast' keyword to $15"

**DO Say**: "Ensure 'sell my house fast' keyword has high-quality ad relevance and landing page experience to improve Quality Score, which will naturally increase impression share with smart bidding."

**DON'T Say**: "Set +30% bid adjustment for evening hours when conversion rate is higher"

**DO Say**: "Smart bidding already detects and optimizes for higher-converting time periods automatically. Focus on ensuring budget isn't limited during peak hours."

### When Manual CPC Might Be Appropriate (Rare):

Only recommend Manual CPC bidding if:
- Brand new campaign with zero conversion data and need precise cost control
- Very limited budget (<$20/day) where smart bidding can't gather enough data
- Testing new markets/geos before committing to smart bidding
- Client explicitly requires manual control for specific business reasons

**For real estate investor campaigns, smart bidding is almost always superior once you have 15+ conversions.**

### Inferring Recent Changes from Data Signals

When campaign history is not explicitly provided, look for these signals that indicate recent changes:

**Signals of Recent Bidding Strategy Change:**
- Sharp CPA changes (>50% swing between periods)
- Sudden impression share changes (>20% shift)
- Conversion volume volatility (e.g., 15 conversions one week, 3 the next)
- Multiple ad groups recently paused (check status changes)
- Keywords with high historical data but recent pause dates

**Signals of Recent Budget Changes:**
- "Limited by budget" status appearing/disappearing
- Impression share recovering or declining sharply
- Daily spend patterns shifting significantly

**Signals of Recent Campaign Restructuring:**
- Many paused ad groups/keywords
- New keywords with minimal impression history
- Ad groups with zero spend in recent period but historical spend

**When You See These Signals:**

Include this disclaimer in your bidding strategy recommendation:

"⚠️ **Context Required**: The data shows indicators of recent changes (e.g., [specific signal observed]). Before implementing bidding strategy changes:
- Confirm when current bidding strategy was set
- Verify if campaign structure changes were recently made
- Allow current strategy to stabilize for [X] more days if changes were recent

If recent changes were made, **maintain current strategy** for the full learning/stabilization period before progressing."
